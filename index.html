<h2 class="h2-1">History of Mobile Phones</h2> 
<p id="tashkent">
  The journey of mobile phones began in the mid-20th century with early wireless communication systems. In 1973, Martin Cooper of Motorola made history by making the first handheld mobile phone call using the DynaTAC prototype. These devices were bulky, expensive, and had limited functionality, but they marked the start of a new era in communication technology. Over time, innovations in design and technology paved the way for mobile phones to become more practical and accessible. This breakthrough inspired further research and development in the telecommunications industry. It also demonstrated the potential for mobile devices to revolutionize human interaction. The invention of mobile phones was a turning point in how people communicated across distances.

  In the 1980s and 1990s, mobile phone technology advanced with the introduction of 1G and 2G networks. Analog systems transitioned to digital, improving voice clarity and enabling services like SMS. Devices became smaller, cheaper, and more user-friendly, transforming phones from niche business tools into everyday communication devices. Companies like Nokia and Motorola dominated this period, with iconic models such as the Nokia 5110 capturing the publicâ€™s imagination. The era also saw significant growth in mobile network coverage, connecting more people worldwide. This progress marked the beginning of mobile phones becoming indispensable in daily life.
